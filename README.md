# calendar_ewb
The goal was to send an calendar appointement from python. 
The code uses an outlook adresse email and the app to work. The persons who received the mail have to says if they are going or not, so the sender received a notification to led him know the answer. 

The second code (rating) lets us send a mail with a web site, to rate the driver.
